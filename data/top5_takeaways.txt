1. Data Exfiltration
- What this means: Data exfiltration occurs when sensitive or confidential data is extracted and transferred out of an organization's network without authorization, often for malicious purposes such as financial gain or espionage. This can happen through various means, including phishing emails, compromised systems, or unsecured networks.
- What impact: The impact of data exfiltration can be severe, causing significant financial loss, damage to reputation, and compromise of sensitive information. In some cases, it may even lead to legal consequences for organizations that fail to protect their data.
- How to mitigate: To mitigate the risk of data exfiltration, organizations should implement robust security controls, such as encryption, access controls, and network segmentation. They should also conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify weaknesses and implement effective incident response plans.

2. System Compromise
- What this means: A system compromise occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a computer or network, allowing them to steal sensitive information, disrupt operations, or install malware.
- What impact: The impact of a system compromise can be severe, including financial loss, damage to reputation, and compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.
- How to mitigate: To mitigate the risk of a system compromise, it is essential to implement robust security measures such as multi-factor authentication, regular software updates, and intrusion detection systems, as well as educating users on safe computing practices.

3. Network Access
- What this means: The risk of unauthorized network access occurs when an individual gains access to a computer system or network without proper authorization, potentially leading to data breaches and intellectual property theft.
- What impact: Unauthorized network access can result in significant financial losses, damage to reputation, and legal consequences. It can also compromise sensitive information and disrupt business operations.
- How to mitigate: To mitigate this risk, ensure that all network connections are secure, use strong passwords and keep them confidential, regularly update software and operating systems, and implement strict access controls.

4. Lateral Movement
- What this means: Lateral movement refers to an attacker's ability to move across a network or system without being detected, often using stolen credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities. This can allow them to access sensitive data and systems.
- What impact: If left unchecked, lateral movement can lead to significant damage to an organization's security posture, including data breaches, system compromise, and intellectual property theft.
- How to mitigate: To mitigate the risk of lateral movement, organizations should implement robust access controls, monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, and conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

5. Reputation Damage
- What this means: Reputation damage refers to harm caused to an organization's public image or brand reputation. This can occur through negative publicity, customer complaints, or poor business practices.
- What impact: Reputation damage can have significant financial and social impacts, including lost sales, decreased employee morale, and erosion of trust among stakeholders.
- How to mitigate: To mitigate reputation damage, organizations should establish a crisis communication plan, respond promptly to incidents, and implement measures to prevent future harm.
